# FutureVolatileSignal: Asynchronous Signal Handling in Go

FutureVolatileSignal provides a robust and efficient mechanism for managing asynchronous signals in Go applications. It aims to simplify signal handling, preventing race conditions and ensuring reliable execution in concurrent environments. This library allows developers to register handlers for specific signals and receive notifications when those signals occur, decoupling signal receipt from processing.

This library addresses a common challenge in Go applications: the inherent complexity of traditional signal handling using `os/signal`. Signal handlers can be invoked asynchronously, potentially interrupting ongoing operations and leading to unexpected behavior, especially when shared resources are involved. FutureVolatileSignal offers a more controlled and predictable approach by using a channel-based signaling mechanism. This allows handlers to execute within a consistent context and prevent race conditions that are difficult to debug and resolve. The library emphasizes a "future" approach, where signal occurrences are treated as events that may or may not have already happened, allowing for flexible and resilient application designs. By abstracting away the intricacies of signal handling, FutureVolatileSignal enables developers to focus on their application logic without being burdened by low-level signal management concerns.

The core principle of FutureVolatileSignal is to capture signals and defer their processing to a safe and controlled environment. When a signal is received, it is immediately stored in a channel, and a goroutine is dispatched to process it. This asynchronous handling ensures that the signal handler does not block the main execution thread. The volatile aspect of the library refers to its ability to handle signals that may occur rapidly and potentially be missed by traditional signal handlers. By buffering signals, FutureVolatileSignal minimizes the risk of missing critical events. The library provides an API to subscribe to specific signals, retrieve historical signal occurrences, and customize the handling behavior. This allows developers to tailor the signal handling mechanism to the specific requirements of their applications.

## Key Features

*   **Asynchronous Signal Handling:** Decouples signal receipt from processing using channels and goroutines, preventing blocking of the main execution thread.
*   **Signal Buffering:** Stores received signals in a buffer to prevent signal loss, particularly important for rapid signal occurrences.
*   **Typed Signal Events:** Each received signal is encapsulated in a `SignalEvent` struct, containing the signal type and timestamp of occurrence.
*   **Multiple Handler Support:** Allows registration of multiple handlers for the same signal, enabling flexible signal processing logic. Each handler is invoked concurrently.
*   **Deferred Processing:** Handlers are executed in separate goroutines, ensuring that signal processing does not interfere with the main application flow.
*   **Error Handling:** Provides mechanisms for handling errors that may occur during signal processing, such as panics or timeouts.

## Technology Stack

*   **Go (golang):** The primary programming language used to implement the library. Leverages Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines and channels) for asynchronous signal handling.
*   **`os/signal` package:** Used for receiving operating system signals. The library builds upon this package to provide a higher-level abstraction.
*   **`sync` package:** Used for synchronization primitives (e.g., `sync.Mutex`) to ensure thread safety when accessing shared resources.
*   **`time` package:** Used for timestamping signal events and managing timeouts.

## Installation

1.  Ensure you have Go installed and configured correctly. You can download Go from [https://golang.org/dl/](https://golang.org/dl/).
2.  Create a new Go module (if you don't already have one): `go mod init <your_module_name>`.
3.  Import the FutureVolatileSignal library: `go get github.com/uhsr/FutureVolatileSignal`.
4.  Include the library in your Go code using the `import` statement:
import (
"github.com/uhsr/FutureVolatileSignal"
)

## Configuration

The FutureVolatileSignal library can be configured using environment variables or directly through code.

*   **`SIGNAL_BUFFER_SIZE` (optional):** Specifies the size of the signal buffer. Defaults to 100 if not set.

You can set the environment variable as follows:
export SIGNAL_BUFFER_SIZE=200

Alternatively, you can configure the buffer size programmatically:

config := FutureVolatileSignal.Config{BufferSize: 200}
signalHandler := FutureVolatileSignal.NewSignalHandler(config)

## Usage

The following example demonstrates how to use the FutureVolatileSignal library:

Example:
handler := FutureVolatileSignal.NewSignalHandler(FutureVolatileSignal.Config{})

// Register a handler for SIGINT
handler.RegisterHandler(syscall.SIGINT, func(event FutureVolatileSignal.SignalEvent) {
fmt.Println("Received SIGINT signal at:", event.Timestamp)
})

// Start listening for signals
handler.Start()

// Send a SIGINT signal (for testing purposes)
syscall.Kill(syscall.Getpid(), syscall.SIGINT)

// Stop the signal handler (optional)
handler.Stop()
